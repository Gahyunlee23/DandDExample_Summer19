#Lee Gahyun Drag and Drop 
Going over some stuff that almost everyone got slightly worng. Not major stuff, so don;t feel bad, but minor stuff we don't want to keep going.

## Description

There are two siginificant bugs in the original file that we made in class. The first bug is that the drop zone only accept one child so when try to put the other child on top of the drop zone, glich is happend, and the second piece is disappeared. The other bug is that when we click the thimbnail and do the different types of puzzle game, but the pieces that we already put in the previous game are there. Those are not refreshed.
